3rd party Libraries
--------

This library uses multiple 3rd party libaries, listed below.

NOTE: Changes have been made to both libaries; they no longer exactly match the versions available on the web sites.

[ConsoleCommandLibrary ](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/816301/Csharp-Building-a-Useful-Extensible-NET-Console-Ap)

Modifications:

    - Allow using instances instead of static libaries
    - Support async commands
    - Support command result actions - enum used, so actions are limited to hard coded list
    - Support params collection for string and timespan
    - Support nullable timespan as param
    - List default value for optional params
    - Add help/example syntax
    - Added macro support (capture/cancel/save/run)


[ShellControl ](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9621/ShellControl-A-console-emulation-control)

Modifications:

    - Changed code from dot net 1.1 to 4.0.
    - TAB scrolls through list of commmands.
